# First Priorities
- Embed a chessboard on the page with the ability to play moves on it.
- Attach to that page/board a PGN and force the player to play the correct move in the movelist.
- Have a computer play as the opposing side, alterable.
- Add a 'book' via PGN.
- Learn/Review a book option

# Model Ideas
- Line - An individual PGN movelist with optional comments. Includes player perspective. Added to a 'Chapter'?
- Book - A collection of related lines, possibly with 'chapters'?
- User - Obviously

# Later Priorities
- Add lines to a 'book' via a chessboard.
